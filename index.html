                    Nanomedicine is a branch of medicine that involves the study of nanotechnology, which is the manipulating and controlling of materials at the atomic and molecular levels. Nanomedicine has opened up entirely new avenues for treatments. It involves the use of nanoscale materials, such as biocompatible nanoparticles and nanobots, for diagnosis, delivery, sensing or actuation purposes in a living organism. Nanobots, a molecule-sized nanoparticle, have been found effective in the treatment of new diseases. Nanomedicine is still a relatively new branch of medicine and it’s still being tested for safety. In this website, Nanobots for cancer treatment and drug delivery, as well as nanotechnology used for the advancement of surgery are explored.

                    Nanobots are designed from the biological model of bacteria. Nanobots are a fairly new concept and are made in varying forms. Due to their precision, minimum side effects and quicker response nanobots have been found more innovative and supportive of the treatment and diagnosis of cancer, heart attack, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and kidney stones. Nanobots allow personalized treatment and thus achieve high efficiency against many diseases.

                    Carbon is the principal element used in constructing these nanobots. Diamondoid material is used in the construction of the outer shell of the nanobot, due to its inert properties, high thermal conductivity and strength. This super smooth surface helps reduce the chance of triggering the body’s immune system. Bearing, gears, and motors make up the mechanical part of a nanobot. These are constructed using elements like hydrogen, sulphur, oxygen, nitrogen or silicon. Furthermore, the substructures of nanobots are built with onboard power supplies, sensors, nanocomputers, pumps, manipulators, and pressure tanks.

                    Nanotechnology has quickly advanced in the past decade, and scientists believe it to be the future of medicine. Physicist Richard Feynman was the first to speak about the ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology. 
                    <img src="Richard_feynman-s.jpg" alt="Black and white image of Richard Feyman" style="float:right;width:200px; margin-left: auto;" >
                    His talk entitled “There’s Plenty of Room at the Bottom” at an American Physical Society meeting in the California Institute of Technology on December 29, 1959, is considered to be the first lecture on technology and engineering at the atomic scale. Long before the term Nanotechnology was coined, he described a process in which scientists could manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. The term Nanotechnology originated a decade later during Professor Norio Taniguchi’s exploration of ultra-precision machining at Tokyo Science University. Professor Taniguchi used the term nanotechnology to describe the precision machining of materials within atomic-scale dimensional tolerances. The advancement of modern nanotechnology only began after  The Scanning Tunneling microscope that could “see” individual atoms was developed in 1981 by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer.  Since then research in Nanotechnology has boomed. Nanotechnology is being used in many everyday items, such as, lightweight nanotechnology-enabled automobile bumpers that resist denting and scratching, golf balls that fly straighter, stiffer and stronger tennis rackets, nano-silver antibacterials socks, clear sunscreens and improved television, cell phones, and digital camera displays. Research and advancements in Nanotechnology are predicted to grow in all areas from your cell phone to nanobots used for surgical purposes.

                    Nanotechnology can now be used in treating Cancer. Scientists at Arizona State University, along with researchers from the National Center for Nanoscience and Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, have successfully programmed nanorobots to shrink tumours by cutting off their blood supply. For this research, the scientists took advantage of a mouse tumour model, where human cancer cells are injected into the mouse to encourage tumour growth.  Once the tumour has reached a substantial size, the nanobots are then inserted into the mouse.
                </p>
                <p class="indent" id="text">
                    The Nanobots are injected into the mouse through a vein and through that they reach the Tumors. A DNA aptamer is used to make sure the nanobots only attack cancer cells. The aptamer targets a protein called nucleation that's made in high amounts only on the tumour endothelial cells. The nanobots are programmed to release Thrombin once they reach the tumour. Thrombin, a blood-clotting enzyme causes thrombosis to interfere with the blood flow of the tumour growth. This kills the malignant cells. 
                </p>
                <p class="indent" id="text">
                    Subsequently, the nanobots rapidly block the blood supply of the Tumour. These nanobots were made from a flat, rectangular DNA origami sheet, 90 nanometers by 90 nanometers. An average of 4 thrombin molecules was attached to a single nanobot. Then the nanobots were folded into a cylinder. This study is the first to show nanobots are safe and effective in shrinking tumours in animal models. If there is more evidence supporting its safety, in the future this treatment method might be studied in humans.

                    The use of Nanotechnology in surgery possibly will lead to less morbid surgery. Nanotechnology used in surgery is expected to be less traumatic, leading to faster recovery, less fibrosis and fewer operative complications. Nanotechnology for surgeons is extremely beneficial in many ways, tiny biosensors could be constructed which would shorten a patient's recovery period, save hospitals money, reduce infection rates, reduce the waiting lists for operations and doctors can treat more patients in the same period of time.

                    In traditional open surgery, the surgeon cuts through healthy tissue in order to get to the internal organs that need to be operated on. Recently, surgeons have been looking for ways for minimally invasive procedures. Nanoscale lasers are already being used in corneal surgery and have been used to investigate nerve regeneration in worms to provide insight into possible treatments for human neurological diseases.

                    Award-winning scientist and science communicator Dr. Jamie Gallagher said, “ Currently if something in your body goes wrong, we flood the whole body with medicine. Using nanotechnology, we could build cages that can seek out just the area of damage and take the medicine directly to them.” Researchers have reported a method where nanobots can swim swiftly through the blood to reach their Delivery destination.

                    In 2015, researchers working at the University of California in San Diego proved that nanobots can travel inside a living creature and deliver their medicinal load without any harmful effects. Nanobots propelled by gas bubbles, made from a reaction with the contents of the stomach when they are deposited, were successfully deployed in the body of a live mouse. The nanobots used were tubular and about 5*5 micrometres and coated in zinc. Once the nanobots were ingested by the mouse the zinc reacts with digestive secretions to produce bubbles of hydrogen which then propelled the nanobots along like miniature rockets. The bots headed towards the stomach lining and embedding themselves onto it. They then dissolved and delivered a nanoparticle compound directly into the gut tissue.  This research was considered very successful. All of the nanobots that reached the stomach stayed attached to the stomach lining for a full 12 hours after digestion. After the mouse was eventually euthanized and the stomach was dissected, researchers reported no toxicity or tissue damage.

                    The University of California nanobots are the first self-propelled micromachines. This makes the research far more successful and cites the fact that this is now the beginning of a proven method to deliver targeted drug administration. Of course, more research needs to be performed to provide scientific evidence to support its use in humans. However, this study is one of the vital first steps towards a successful nanobot drug delivery system.
